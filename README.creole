= Django-ForRunners

Store your GPX tracks of your running (or other sports activity) in django.


The name **Django-ForRunners** has the origin from the great Android tracking app **ForRunners** by Benoît Hervier: http://rvier.fr/#forrunners

== Features:

* GPX track management:
** Upload GPX tracks
** Import GPX tracks from commandline
** Track analysis:
*** basics: Track length / Duration / Pace / Hart rate Up-/Downhill
*** Display route on OpenStreetMap map
*** Graphs with elevation / heart rate / cadence (if available in GPX data)
** Data that is automatically extracted from the web:
*** Start/finish Address from OpenStreetMap
*** Start/finish weather information from metaweather.com
** Store additional data:
*** Ideal track distance (for easier grouping/filtering tracks)
* sports competitions Management:
** Create a List of Sport Events
*** Add participation to a event
*** link GPX track with a event participation
*** Store you event participation:
**** official track length
**** measured finisher time
**** Number of participants who have finished in your discipline
*** Add links to webpages relatet to this event
*** Record costs (entry fee, T-shirt etc.)
* common
** Multiple user support (However: no rights management and currently only suitable for a handful of users)


== try-out

Just:

 # Download the file [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedie/django-for-runners/master/boot_django_for_runners.sh|boot_django_for_runners.sh]]
 # run {{{boot_django_for_runners.sh}}}

e.g.:

{{{
~$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jedie/django-for-runners/master/boot_django_for_runners.sh -o boot_django_for_runners.sh
~$ chmod +x boot_django_for_runners.sh
~$ ./boot_django_for_runners.sh
}}}

The shell script creates a python virtual environment and install all needed requirements in you home directory, here:

 * {{{~/Django-ForRunners}}}
 
The setup routine will install two commands:

* {{{ ~/Django-ForRunners/bin/for_runners }}} - CLI to start the web server to use Django-ForRunners
* {{{ ~/Django-ForRunners/bin/manage }}} - Run django manage commands with Django-ForRunners project settings


start the development server with the test project, e.g.:

{{{
~$ ~/DjangoForRunnersEnv/bin/for_runners
}}}

You can also just double click on {{{ ~/Django-ForRunners/bin/for_runners }}} in your file manage ;)


=== import GPX files

e.g.:

{{{
~$ ~/Django-ForRunners/bin/manage import_gpx --username <username> ~/backups/gpx_files
}}}

**Note:** It is no problem to start **import_gpx** with the same GPX files: Duplicate entries are avoided. The start/finish (time/latitude/longitude) are compared.

== run tests

{{{
# activate the virtualenv:
~$ cd DjangoForRunnersEnv/
~/DjangoForRunnersEnv$ source bin/activate

# run the tests:
(DjangoForRunnersEnv) ~/DjangoForRunnersEnv$ cd src/django-for-runners/
(DjangoForRunnersEnv) ~/DjangoForRunnersEnv/src/django-for-runners$ ./setup.py test

# run text via tox:
(DjangoForRunnersEnv) ~/DjangoForRunnersEnv/src/django-for-runners$ ./setup.py tox
}}}


**Note:**

To run all tests, you need:

* **Chromium Browser WebDriver** e.g.: {{{apt install chromium-chromedriver}}}
* **Firefox Browser WebDriver** aka **geckodriver**

install **geckodriver** e.g.:
{{{
~$ cd /tmp
/tmp$ wget https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases/download/v0.20.1/geckodriver-v0.20.1-linux64.tar.gz -O geckodriver.tar.gz
/tmp$ sudo sh -c 'tar -x geckodriver -zf geckodriver.tar.gz -O > /usr/bin/geckodriver'
/tmp$ sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/geckodriver
/tmp$ rm geckodriver.tar.gz
/tmp$ geckodriver --version
geckodriver 0.20.1
...
}}}


== some notes


=== GPX storage

Currently we store the unchanged GPX data in a TextField.


=== static files

We collect some JavaScript files, for easier startup. These files are:

|= Project Homepage |= License |= storage directory
| [[http://leafletjs.com|leafletjs.com]] | [[https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/blob/master/LICENSE|Leaflet licensed under BSD]] | [[https://github.com/jedie/django-for-runners/tree/master/for_runners/static/leaflet|for_runners/static/leaflet/]]
| [[http://dygraphs.com|dygraphs.com]] | [[https://github.com/danvk/dygraphs/blob/master/LICENSE.txt|dygraphs licensed under MIT]] | [[https://github.com/jedie/django-for-runners/tree/master/for_runners/static/dygraphs|for_runners/static/dygraphs/]]
| [[http://www.chartjs.org|chartjs.org]] | [[https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/master/LICENSE.md|Chart.js licensed under MIT]] | [[https://github.com/jedie/django-for-runners/tree/master/for_runners/static/chartjs|for_runners/static/chartjs/]]


=== Precision of coordinates

GPX files from Garmin (can) contain:

* latitude with 29 decimal places
* longitude with 28 decimal places
* elevation with 19 decimal places

The route on OpenStreetMap does not look more detailed, with more than 5 decimal places.
