(The name **Django-ForRunners** has the origin from the great Android tracking app **ForRunners** by Beno√Æt Hervier: http://rvier.fr/#forrunners )

== Features:

* GPX track management:
** Upload GPX tracks
** Import GPX tracks from commandline
** Track analysis:
*** basics: Track length / Duration / Pace / Hart rate Up-/Downhill
*** Display route on OpenStreetMap map
*** Graphs with elevation / heart rate / cadence (if available in GPX data)
** Data that is automatically extracted from the web:
*** Start/finish Address from OpenStreetMap
*** Start/finish weather information from metaweather.com
** Store additional data:
*** Ideal track distance (for easier grouping/filtering tracks)
* sports competitions Management:
** Create a List of Sport Events
*** Add participation to a event
*** link GPX track with a event participation
*** Store you event participation:
**** official track length
**** measured finisher time
**** Number of participants who have finished in your discipline
*** Add links to webpages relatet to this event
*** Record costs (entry fee, T-shirt etc.)
* common
** Multiple user support (However: no rights management and currently only suitable for a handful of users)


* Install as [[https://yunohost.org|YunoHost]] App via [[https://github.com/YunoHost-Apps/django-for-runners_ynh|django-for-runners_ynh]]

=== local development installation

{{{
# install or update Poetry:
~/django-for-runners$ make install-poetry

# install  Django-ForRunners via poetry:
~/django-for-runners$ make install
...

# Collectstatic + makemigration + migrate:
~/django-for-runners$ make manage-update

# Create a django super user:
~/django-for-runners$ ./manage.sh createsuperuser

# start local dev. web server:
~/django-for-runners$ make run-dev-server
}}}

The web page is available in Port 8000, e.g.: {{{http://127.0.0.1:8000/}}}


=== import GPX files

e.g.:

{{{
~/django-for-runners$ poetry run manage import_gpx --username <django_username> ~/backups/gpx_files
}}}

**Note:** It is no problem to start **import_gpx** with the same GPX files: Duplicate entries are avoided. The start/finish (time/latitude/longitude) are compared.


=== backup

Create a backup into {{{.../backups/<timestamp>/}}} e.g.:
{{{
~/django-for-runners$ poetry run for_runners backup
}}}

The backup does:

 * backup the database
 * export all GPX tracks
 * generate .csv files:
    * a complete file with all running tracks
    * one file for every user


=== regenerate all SVG files

{{{
~/django-for-runners$ poetry run for_runners recreate-svg
}}}

* **Firefox Browser WebDriver** aka **geckodriver**

install **geckodriver** e.g.:
{{{
~$ cd /tmp

== some notes


=== GPX storage

Currently we store the unchanged GPX data in a TextField.


=== static files

We collect some JavaScript files, for easier startup. These files are:

|= Project Homepage |= License |= storage directory
| [[http://leafletjs.com|leafletjs.com]] | [[https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet/blob/master/LICENSE|Leaflet licensed under BSD]] | [[https://github.com/jedie/django-for-runners/tree/master/for_runners/static/leaflet|for_runners/static/leaflet/]]
| [[http://dygraphs.com|dygraphs.com]] | [[https://github.com/danvk/dygraphs/blob/master/LICENSE.txt|dygraphs licensed under MIT]] | [[https://github.com/jedie/django-for-runners/tree/master/for_runners/static/dygraphs|for_runners/static/dygraphs/]]
| [[http://www.chartjs.org|chartjs.org]] | [[https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/master/LICENSE.md|Chart.js licensed under MIT]] | [[https://github.com/jedie/django-for-runners/tree/master/for_runners/static/chartjs|for_runners/static/chartjs/]]


=== Precision of coordinates

GPX files from Garmin (can) contain:

* latitude with 29 decimal places
* longitude with 28 decimal places
* elevation with 19 decimal places

The route on OpenStreetMap does not look more detailed, with more than 5 decimal places.
